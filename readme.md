1. This project is a bar chart generator created using HTML, CSS, jQuery and JS.
2. Below is an example input that can be used to generate one such bar chart.

drawBarChart([2, 3, 4, 9, 25, 23, 24],[10, 75, "purple", "center", "Students in Current Cohort"], "main");

Where the first input is the values for bar chart. Second input is an array where the first value is unit length of each bar. Second value is the width between each bar. Third value is the background colour of each bar. Fourth value is to align the value inside the bar either to left venter or right. Fifth value is the title of bar chart.

And lastly, the third input is sued to give the HTML element the bar chart is appended to.

3. Here is the example of bar chart generated.

4. I was not able to generate a grid for this bar chart. In addition I was not able to understand the Multiple Value (Stacked) bar charts requirements and therefore naturally unable to implement.
5. I did not user a lot of external resources for this project except going through Angela Yoo’s Udemy tutorial on jQuery as well as CSS. I also watched Colt Steele’s flex box tutorial. Before styling this website.
